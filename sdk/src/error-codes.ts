/**
 * Machine-readable SDK error codes exposed as a const object so callers can
 * reference codes without hard-coding strings.
 *
 * - `NOT_FOUND` — DID, credential, or reporter record does not exist
 * - `UNAUTHORIZED` — caller is not authorised for the requested operation
 * - `ALREADY_EXISTS` — creation conflicts with an existing record
 * - `INVALID_INPUT` — caller-provided data failed schema/shape validation
 * - `INVALID_ADDRESS` — address fails Stellar ed25519 format validation
 * - `INVALID_PROOF` — presentation proof.jws signature is invalid
 * - `INVALID_ARGUMENT` — a required argument is missing or malformed
 * - `NETWORK_ERROR` — generic transport or connection failure
 * - `NETWORK_TIMEOUT` — network call timed out before a response arrived
 * - `RPC_ERROR` — the RPC node returned an unexpected non-contract error
 * - `CONTRACT_ERROR` — contract returned a non-zero error code or simulation failed
 * - `CONTRACT_PANIC` — contract execution panicked (host environment error)
 * - `INSUFFICIENT_FEE` — transaction fee below network minimum
 * - `LEDGER_CLOSED` — ledger closed before the transaction was included
 * - `RATE_LIMITED` — request rate limit exhausted
 * - `TIMEOUT` — polling or overall operation timed out
 * - `BATCH_TOO_LARGE` — more than 50 credential IDs passed to revokeBatch
 * - `VALIDATION_ERROR` — retained for backwards-compatibility
 * - `UNKNOWN` — fallback when no other code fits
