# Accessibility

The frontend targets WCAG 2.1 Level AA. This documents what is implemented,
how it is tested, and what still needs a human with a screen reader.

## Landmarks and skip link

The page opens with a skip link (`.skip-link`) that is positioned off-screen
until focused and targets `#main-content`. `<main id="main-content"
tabindex="-1">` wraps the tab panels so the skip target can actually receive
focus; `main:focus` clears the outline because the landmark is not itself an
interactive control (WCAG 2.4.1).

## Keyboard navigation

Every interactive element is reachable and operable by keyboard.

The section switcher implements the WAI-ARIA tab pattern:

| Key | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `Tab` | Enters the tablist at the selected tab, then leaves it |
| `←` / `→` | Move to the previous / next tab, wrapping at the ends |
| `Home` / `End` | Jump to the first / last tab |

Only the selected tab carries `tabindex="0"` (roving tabindex), so a keyboard
user tabs *into* the tablist once rather than through every tab. Each tab is
`role="tab"` with `aria-selected` and `aria-controls`; each panel is
`role="tabpanel"` labelled by its tab, with the inactive panel `hidden` rather
than removed so the labelling relationship survives.

## Focus indicators

`:focus-visible` paints a 2px `--focus-ring` outline with a 2px offset, so
mouse users do not see a ring but keyboard users always do (WCAG 2.4.7).
`[role="button"]` elements — the credential cards — get the same treatment.
Under `forced-colors: active` the ring falls back to the system `Highlight`
colour, since custom outline colours are stripped in that mode.

## Form labels

Every input has a programmatically associated name (WCAG 1.3.1, 3.3.2):

- `FormField` renders a real `<label htmlFor>` and wires `aria-invalid` plus
  `aria-describedby` to a `role="alert"` error message.
- Single-purpose inputs (resolve address, credential search, verify ID) have a
  `<label class="visually-hidden">` where an on-screen label would be
  redundant. `.visually-hidden` uses the clip-path pattern, which keeps the
  text in the accessibility tree — unlike `display: none`.
- Repeated rows (metadata pairs, claim pairs) use indexed `aria-label`s
  ("Metadata key 1", "Claim value 2") so each field is distinguishable when
  navigating by form control.
- The reputation chart's date filters are associated by `htmlFor`/`id`.

A placeholder is never the only label.

## Status and live regions

The RPC connection indicator is `role="status" aria-live="polite"`, so a change
is announced without stealing focus. Decorative glyphs
(the ⚠ prefixes, the coloured connection dot) are `aria-hidden="true"` so they
are not read out as punctuation.

## Images

The app renders no `<img>` elements, so there is no missing alt text today. The
one graphic is the DID QR code, which is accompanied by the DID string as
visible text so its information is available without reading the image (WCAG
1.1.1). The favicon is an inline SVG data URI in `index.html`. Any `<img>` added
later needs an `alt` attribute — descriptive when it carries meaning, `alt=""`
when it is decorative.

## Reduced motion

`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` collapses animation and transition durations
and disables smooth scrolling (WCAG 2.3.3).

## Automated testing

`axe-core` runs against rendered components in `src/a11y.test.tsx` and
`src/App.a11y.test.tsx`:

```bash
cd frontend
npx vitest run src/a11y.test.tsx src/App.a11y.test.tsx
```

The `color-contrast` rule is disabled in these runs because jsdom has no layout
or computed styles for axe to measure — contrast is verified against the running
app instead. Everything else runs with axe's defaults.

`src/setupTests.ts` stubs `window.matchMedia`, which jsdom does not implement
and `useTheme` reads on mount, and is registered via `setupFiles` in
`vite.config.ts`.

## Manual verification still required

Automated tooling catches roughly a third of WCAG issues. These need a person:

- **Screen readers** — NVDA (Firefox) and JAWS (Chrome) on Windows, VoiceOver
  (Safari) on macOS. Confirm reading order, that tab changes are announced, and
  that panel content is reached in a sensible order.
- **Colour contrast** — verify text and focus rings against both themes at 4.5:1
  for body text and 3:1 for large text and UI components.
- **Zoom and reflow** — 200% zoom and a 320px viewport with no horizontal
  scrolling (WCAG 1.4.10).
- **Keyboard-only walkthrough** — issue, verify, and resolve flows end to end
  without touching a pointer.

## Biometric authentication

WebAuthn backs the biometric sign-in flow (fingerprint, Face ID, Windows
Hello). The browser prompt is owned by the platform, not by the app, so the
accessibility surface is the fallback path and the device management UI.

### Browser compatibility

| Browser | Minimum version | Platform authenticator | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome / Chromium | 67 | Touch ID (macOS), Windows Hello, Android fingerprint/face | `platform` authenticator via `navigator.credentials.create` |
| Safari | 13 (macOS), 13 (iOS) | Touch ID, Face ID | Face ID requires a user gesture and a secure context |
| Edge | 18 (EdgeHTML), 79 (Chromium) | Windows Hello | Chromium builds behave as Chrome |
| Firefox | 60 | Windows Hello, Android fingerprint | Touch ID on macOS supported from 66 |

Requirements: a secure context (HTTPS or `localhost`), and
`window.PublicKeyCredential` plus
`PublicKeyCredential.isUserVerifyingPlatformAuthenticatorAvailable()`
resolving `true`. Where those are missing the biometric button is not
rendered at all, so there is no dead control to tab to.

### Known limitations

- Platform authenticators are per-device. A credential registered on a phone
  is not usable on a laptop; each device must be enrolled separately.
- iOS Safari shows the Face ID / Touch ID sheet outside the page, so page
  zoom, custom focus rings and `prefers-reduced-motion` do not apply to it.
- Some Android browsers fall back to a PIN or pattern instead of a biometric
  when no fingerprint is enrolled. The prompt still satisfies user
  verification, so the flow succeeds.
- Firefox on Linux has no platform authenticator; only the password/wallet
  fallback is offered.
- The credential is bound to the origin. Changing the frontend origin
  invalidates existing registrations and users must re-enrol.

### Fallback behaviour

Password and wallet sign-in remain available at all times and are never
hidden behind the biometric option:

- If WebAuthn is unsupported, the biometric control is absent and the
  password form is the only path.
- If the user cancels or the platform prompt fails, focus returns to the
  biometric button and an inline `role="alert"` message explains the failure
  and points at the password form. The error is announced because it is a
  live region, not because focus moved.
- The device management UI lists enrolled devices with a "Remove" button per
  device. Removing the last device leaves password sign-in intact.

### Screen-reader behaviour

The platform prompt is not in the accessibility tree of the page, so screen
readers announce it through the OS (VoiceOver announces the Face ID sheet,
NVDA announces the Windows Hello dialog). Nothing in the app can label it.
What the app does control:

- The biometric button has a visible label plus an `aria-label` naming the
  authenticator ("Sign in with Touch ID").
- While the prompt is open the button is `aria-busy="true"` and disabled, so
  it is not re-triggered by a stray Enter.
- Success and failure are announced through the same `role="status"` /
  `role="alert"` pattern used elsewhere in the app.
- The device list is a real `<ul>` with one remove button per item, each
  labelled with the device name, so it is navigable by list and by button.

### Manual test results

| Platform | Browser | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| iOS 17 | Safari | Face ID registration and sign-in pass; fallback to password pass |
| Android 14 | Chrome | Fingerprint registration and sign-in pass; PIN fallback pass |
| Windows 11 | Chrome / Edge | Windows Hello pass; fallback pass |
| macOS 14 | Safari / Chrome | Touch ID pass; fallback pass |

Re-run these whenever the WebAuthn options change, since the platform prompt
is not covered by the automated axe runs.

## Voice commands

Voice input uses the Web Speech API (`SpeechRecognition` /
`webkitSpeechRecognition`). It is an enhancement: every command has a
keyboard-accessible equivalent, and the feature is never the only way to
reach a control.

### Browser compatibility

| Browser | Support | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome / Chromium | Yes | `webkitSpeechRecognition`; requires a network round trip for recognition |
| Edge | Yes | Chromium builds behave as Chrome |
| Safari | Partial | `webkitSpeechRecognition` on macOS and iOS; iOS recognition is short-lived and stops on backgrounding |
| Firefox | No | The API is not implemented; the microphone control is not rendered |

Where the API is missing the microphone button is absent rather than
disabled, so there is no unreachable control in the tab order.

### Recognition accuracy

Recognition is server-side and varies with accent, background noise and
microphone quality. Known limitations:

- Numbers and hex strings (DIDs, credential IDs) are frequently misheard;
  the app reads the transcript back for confirmation before acting.
- Accuracy degrades in noisy environments and with long utterances.
- Non-English recognition depends on the browser's language packs; the
  language selector only offers locales the browser reports as available.
- Recognition stops after a period of silence; the user restarts it with the
  same button.

### Microphone permission

The browser prompts for microphone access on first use. If permission is
denied the app shows an inline `role="alert"` explaining how to re-enable it
in browser settings, and the keyboard alternative remains available. The
permission prompt itself is browser chrome and is not announced by the page.

### Keyboard alternative

Every voice command has a keyboard path, so voice is never required:

| Voice command | Keyboard equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Search | Focus the search field and type |
| Navigate to a section | `Tab` to the tablist, then `←` / `→` |
| Verify | Focus the verify button and press `Enter` |

The microphone button is a real `<button>` with an `aria-label`, reachable by
`Tab` and toggled with `Enter` or `Space`.

### Visual and screen-reader feedback

While listening, the button shows a pulsing indicator and the state is exposed
as `aria-pressed="true"` with a `role="status"` message ("Listening…"). The
pulse is suppressed under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`; the status text
carries the same information without motion.

Recognised commands are announced through a polite live region before they
run ("Verifying credential 0x…"), and failures through `role="alert"`. The
transcript is never the only feedback: the resulting UI change is also
announced, so a screen-reader user who misses the transcript still hears the
outcome.

## Automated testing (#827)

`tests/a11y/` runs axe-core through Playwright against every frontend route on each PR (`.github/workflows/a11y.yml`). The build fails on any **critical** or **serious** WCAG 2.1 AA violation. Violation reports are uploaded as the `a11y-report` artifact.

### Requirements
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance.
- Text contrast of at least 4.5:1, and 3:1 for large text and UI components.
- Every interactive element can be reached by keyboard and shows a visible focus indicator.
- Each page has one `main` landmark and one `h1`.
- Form controls have labels. Icon-only buttons have an `aria-label`.
- ARIA roles and attributes are valid. `aria-hidden` is never set on a focusable element.

### PR accessibility checklist
- [ ] `npm test` in `tests/a11y` passes locally, or the CI `a11y` job is green
- [ ] New UI can be operated with the keyboard alone (Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space, Esc)
- [ ] Focus stays visible and follows a logical order. Modals trap focus and restore it when closed
- [ ] Images have `alt` text. Decorative images use `alt=""`
- [ ] Colour is not the only way information is shown
- [ ] Checked with a screen reader (NVDA, JAWS or VoiceOver) for any significant UI change
