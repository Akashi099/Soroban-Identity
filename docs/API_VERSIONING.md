# API Versioning Strategy & Deprecation Policy

Soroban Identity implements a flexible API versioning strategy designed for backward compatibility, predictable evolution, and seamless client migration.

---

## 1. Supported Versioning Mechanisms

The API supports three complementary version negotiation methods:

### A. URL Path Prefix (Recommended)
Prepend the version identifier directly in the route path:
```http
GET /v1/credentials
GET /v2/credentials
POST /v1/webhooks
GET /v1/graphql
```

### B. Accept-Version Header
Specify the version in a dedicated HTTP header:
```http
GET /credentials HTTP/1.1
Host: api.soroban-identity.example
Accept-Version: v2
```

### C. Vendor Accept MIME Type
Negotiate version via the standard `Accept` header:
```http
GET /credentials HTTP/1.1
Host: api.soroban-identity.example
Accept: application/vnd.soroban-identity.v2+json
```

### D. Default Fallback (Backward Compatibility)
Requests to unversioned endpoints (e.g. `/credentials`, `/health`, `/info`) default to **`v1`** without breaking legacy integrations.

## Route Structure

Version-specific route helpers live under `server/src/routes/`:

| File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `server/src/routes/version-middleware.js` | `applyVersioning(req, res, url)` – resolves version, sets headers, attaches `req.apiVersion` |
| `server/src/routes/v1.js` | v1 route map, `withV1Prefix`, `stripV1Prefix`, pass-through `wrapResponse` |
| `server/src/routes/v2.js` | v2 route map, `withV2Prefix`, v2 envelope `wrapResponse` / `toV2` |

### Using the middleware in a route handler

```js
import { applyVersioning } from "./routes/version-middleware.js";
import { toV2 } from "./routes/v2.js";

// Inside the request handler:
const { version, normalizedPath } = applyVersioning(req, res, url);
const payload = { items: [...], nextCursor: null };
return sendJson(res, 200, version === "v2" ? toV2(payload) : payload);
```

## 2. Supported Versions

| Version | Status | Release Date | Deprecation Date | Sunset Date |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`v1`** | `Active` (Default) | 2024-01-01 | — | — |
| **`v2`** | `Active` | 2024-06-01 | — | — |

---

## 3. Version Differences (v1 vs v2)

### Credential Listing (`GET /credentials` or `GET /v2/credentials`)

- **v1 Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "items": [...],
    "nextCursor": "cred-xyz"
  }
  ```

- **v2 Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "apiVersion": "v2",
    "data": {
      "items": [...],
      "pageInfo": {
        "nextCursor": "cred-xyz",
        "hasNextPage": true,
        "count": 50
      }
    },
    "meta": {
      "timestamp": "2026-08-25T11:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
  ```

### Health Check Endpoint (`GET /health` or `GET /v1/health` or `GET /v2/health`)

All health responses include versioning metadata:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "supportedVersions": ["v1", "v2"],
  "deprecatedVersions": [],
  "defaultVersion": "v1",
  "contracts": {
    "identity": true,
    "credential": true,
    "reputation": true
  },
  "circuitBreaker": {
    "state": "CLOSED"
  }
}
```

## 4. Deprecation & Sunset Policy

To provide stability for enterprise integrators, the API follows a strict deprecation timeline:

1. **Announcement & Grace Period:**
   - Any version scheduled for deprecation will remain fully operational for at least **6 months** prior to sunset.
2. **Deprecation Headers:**
   - When a client invokes a deprecated version or endpoint, the response includes standard HTTP deprecation headers:
     - `Deprecation: true`
     - `Sunset: <RFC-3339 timestamp>` (date of removal)
     - `Link: <documentation URL>; rel="deprecation"`
     - `X-API-Version: <version>`
3. **Sunset / Retirement:**
   - Following the sunset date, requests to retired versions will return `HTTP 410 Gone` with migration guidelines.

---

## 5. Per-Endpoint Deprecation (#751)

Section 4 covers deprecating an entire API *version*. An individual *endpoint*
can also be deprecated independently — e.g. a legacy alias that's superseded
by a more explicit route, without deprecating the version it lives in.

### How it works

`server/src/deprecation.js` maintains a registry of deprecated endpoints,
each entry naming the method, path pattern, deprecation date, sunset date,
and a migration guide link. Every request is checked against this registry
before routing; a match gets the same header treatment as a deprecated
version:

```http
Deprecation: true
Sunset: <RFC-3339 timestamp>
Link: <migration guide URL>; rel="deprecation"
X-Deprecated-Since: <date the endpoint was deprecated>
X-Deprecated-Endpoint: <internal rule name>
```

Usage of a deprecated endpoint is also:
- **Logged** — a `warn`-level log line per request, and a Prometheus counter
  (`deprecated_endpoint_usage_total`, labelled by rule name) for dashboards.
- **Notified** — the first time an authenticated API key hits a deprecated
  endpoint on a given day, its owner is emailed a summary (endpoint, dates,
  migration link). At most one email per key per endpoint per day.

### Currently deprecated

| Endpoint | Deprecated since | Sunset | Replacement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `DELETE /credentials/:id` | 2026-08-27 | 2027-02-27 | `POST /credentials/:id/revoke` (or `DELETE /credentials/:id/revoke`) |

The bare `DELETE /credentials/:id` form is functionally identical to the
`/revoke` endpoints — see the revoke handler in `server/src/app.js` — but its
path doesn't name the action, and reads as a generic "delete this resource"
call that credential revocation isn't. The `/revoke` suffix forms are not
deprecated and remain the supported way to revoke a credential.

### Timeline policy

Per-endpoint deprecations follow the same **minimum 6-month** grace period
as version-level deprecations (Section 4): a deprecated endpoint keeps
working, with warning headers, for at least 6 months before its sunset date.
After sunset, the endpoint is removed from the registry along with the route
handler itself, at which point it returns `404`.
