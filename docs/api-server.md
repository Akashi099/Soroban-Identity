# SDK + Server layer

Helpers exposed alongside the SDK for any host application that wants
to expose Soroban-Identity over HTTP. Four issues land in this folder:

| Issue | File | Surface |
|-------|------|---------|
| [#249](https://github.com/El-Chapo-Npm/Soroban-Identity/issues/249) | `sdk/src/errors.ts` | `SorobanIdentityError` envelope + `SorobanErrorCode` union + `classifyError` / `wrapError` helpers |
| [#252](https://github.com/El-Chapo-Npm/Soroban-Identity/issues/252) | `sdk/src/server/webhooks.ts` | `WebhookStore` + `registerWebhook` + `WebhookDispatcher` |
| [#253](https://github.com/El-Chapo-Npm/Soroban-Identity/issues/253) | `sdk/src/server/api-keys.ts` | `ApiKeyStore` + `issueApiKey` + `createApiKeyAuthMiddleware` |
| [#254](https://github.com/El-Chapo-Npm/Soroban-Identity/issues/254) | `sdk/src/server/rate-limit.ts` | `TokenBucketRateLimiter` + `createRateLimitMiddleware` |

## Error envelope (#249)

```ts
import { SorobanIdentityError } from "@soroban-identity/sdk";

throw new SorobanIdentityError("DID already registered", {
  code: "ALREADY_EXISTS",
  details: { address: "GABC..." },
});

// In the HTTP layer:
res.status(409).json({ error: err.toEnvelope() });
// → { code: "ALREADY_EXISTS", message: "DID already registered", details: { address: "GABC..." } }
```

Codes: `NOT_FOUND | UNAUTHORIZED | ALREADY_EXISTS | INVALID_INPUT | NETWORK_ERROR | CONTRACT_ERROR | RATE_LIMITED | VALIDATION_ERROR | UNKNOWN`.

Helpers:
- `classifyError(msg)` — regex-based code derivation (used internally when wrapping unknown throws).
- `wrapError(err)` — idempotent; passes through existing `SorobanIdentityError`, classifies + wraps everything else.

## Webhook delivery (#252)

```ts
import { InMemoryWebhookStore, registerWebhook, WebhookDispatcher } from "@soroban-identity/sdk";

const store = new InMemoryWebhookStore();
const reg = await registerWebhook(store, {
  url: "https://customer.example/hook",
  secret: "at-least-16-chars-please",
  events: ["credential.issued", "credential.revoked"],
});

const dispatcher = new WebhookDispatcher({ maxAttempts: 5, baseDelayMs: 250 });
const result = await dispatcher.deliver(reg, "credential.issued", { credentialId: "abc" });
// result: { ok, attempts: [...] }
```

- HMAC-SHA256 signed via `X-SorobanIdentity-Signature` header.
- Event type in `X-SorobanIdentity-Event`.
- Delivery id in `X-SorobanIdentity-Delivery-Id` (for idempotent receiver-side dedupe).
- Retry policy: 5xx + 429 + transport errors retried with exponential backoff. Other 4xx fast-fail (caller misconfig).
- Receiver-side verification: `verifySignature(secret, body, signature)` does constant-time comparison.

## API key authentication (#253)

```ts
import { InMemoryApiKeyStore, issueApiKey, createApiKeyAuthMiddleware } from "@soroban-identity/sdk";

const store = new InMemoryApiKeyStore();
const { rawKey, metadata } = await issueApiKey(store, { owner: "alice", scopes: ["read", "write"] });
// Return rawKey to alice ONCE; only the hash is persisted.

app.use(createApiKeyAuthMiddleware({ store, requireScope: "write" }));
```

- `Authorization: Bearer sk_<hex>` parsed via `parseAuthorizationHeader`.
- Keys stored as `sha256(rawKey)` only.
- 401 + envelope on missing / invalid / scope-mismatched keys.
- `req.auth = { apiKey: ApiKeyMetadata }` attached for downstream middleware (e.g. rate limiter keys by `apiKey.id`).

Admin endpoints (recommended host wiring):
- `POST /admin/api-keys` → `issueApiKey`
- `GET /admin/api-keys` → `store.list`
- `DELETE /admin/api-keys/:id` → `store.remove`

## Rate limiting (#254, #681)

```ts
import { createRateLimitMiddleware, TIER_LIMITS } from "@soroban-identity/sdk";

app.use(createApiKeyAuthMiddleware({ store }));
app.use(createRateLimitMiddleware({
  read: { limit: 60, windowMs: 60_000 },
  write: { limit: 20, windowMs: 60_000 },
}));
```

Token-bucket rate limiter with multi-tier throttling based on user subscription levels:

| Tier | Read Limit (req/min) | Write Limit (req/min) | Overall Max (req/min) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Free** | 60 | 20 | 60 |
| **Pro** | 300 | 100 | 300 |
| **Enterprise** | 1200 | 500 | 1200 |

Default classifier treats GET/HEAD/OPTIONS as reads. The
bucket key is `req.auth?.apiKey.id` (when authenticated) or
`ip:<address>` (when not). Per-key overrides supported via the
`overrides` map.

Every response carries:
- `X-RateLimit-Tier` (`free`, `pro`, or `enterprise`)
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`
- `X-RateLimit-Reset` (unix seconds)

When exhausted: `429 Too Many Requests` + `Retry-After` (seconds) +
envelope body `{ error: { code: "RATE_LIMITED", tier: "free", upgrade: { ... } } }`.
For free tier clients, responses also include upgrade information prompting migration to Pro or Enterprise.

Limits are configurable via environment variables when host
applications read them at startup; defaults match the issue's spec.

## Content Negotiation (#683)

The API server supports multiple response formats based on the client's `Accept` HTTP header.

### Supported Media Types
- **JSON** (Default): `application/json`, `*/*`, `application/*`
- **XML**: `application/xml`, `text/xml`
- **YAML**: `application/yaml`, `application/x-yaml`, `text/yaml`, `text/x-yaml`

### Content Negotiation Behavior
1. When no `Accept` header is present or `*/*` is provided, responses are formatted as `application/json; charset=utf-8`.
2. When `Accept: application/xml` or `Accept: text/xml` is specified, responses are serialized as standard XML with `application/xml; charset=utf-8`.
3. When `Accept: application/yaml` or `Accept: text/yaml` is specified, responses are serialized as YAML with `application/yaml; charset=utf-8`.
4. Quality factors (`q` parameter, e.g. `application/xml;q=0.9, application/json;q=0.8`) are parsed and respected in order of client preference.
5. If the requested media type is unsupported and cannot be satisfied (e.g. `Accept: image/png` or `Accept: text/html`), the server returns `406 Not Acceptable`:

```json
{
  "error": "not_acceptable",
  "code": "NOT_ACCEPTABLE",
  "message": "Unsupported format requested in Accept header. Supported formats: application/json, application/xml, text/xml, application/yaml, text/yaml",
  "supportedFormats": [
    "application/json",
    "application/xml",
    "text/xml",
    "application/yaml",
    "text/yaml"
  ]
}
```

## Replay Prevention (#1052)

Sensitive operations are protected against replay attacks using a
nonce-based scheme. Clients must supply a unique nonce per request and
the server rejects any nonce it has already seen.

### Request contract

- Send the nonce in the `X-Nonce` request header.
- Each nonce must be unique per request; reuse is rejected.
- Nonces are single-use and are stored server-side in Redis with a
  **5-minute TTL** (the nonce expiry window). After the window elapses
  the nonce is evicted and may be reused.

```http
POST /credentials HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer sk_<hex>
X-Nonce: 8f14e45fceea167a5a36dedd4bea2543
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Response contract

Every response to a nonce-protected request echoes the nonce that was
accepted (or generated) for that request:

- `X-Nonce` — the nonce associated with the request/response.

Duplicate nonces are rejected with `409 Conflict` and the standard error
envelope:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "ALREADY_EXISTS",
    "message": "Nonce has already been used",
    "details": { "nonce": "8f14e45fceea167a5a36dedd4bea2543" }
  }
}
```

### Client guidance

- Generate a fresh, high-entropy nonce (e.g. 16 random bytes hex-encoded)
  for every sensitive request; never reuse a nonce across requests.
- Treat a `409` replay response as a hard failure — do not retry with the
  same nonce. Generate a new nonce and retry if the operation is still
  desired.
- A nonce may only be reused after its 5-minute expiry window has passed.
- Nonce collisions are monitored server-side; a rising collision rate
  indicates clients are generating insufficiently random nonces.

## API Analytics & Usage Dashboard (#682)

The server includes real-time API analytics monitoring and an administrative usage dashboard.

### Features
- **Requests & Latency Tracking**: Tracks total requests, response times (min, max, average), and error counts per endpoint.
- **Top Consumers**: Tracks API consumption and error rates broken down by API key / client.
- **Geographic Distribution**: Analyzes client geographic traffic distribution based on proxy headers (`CF-IPCountry`, `X-Country`, etc.) and client addresses.
- **Real-Time Graphs**: Interactive dashboard rendering time-series request/error trends and geo breakdown.
- **Export Data**: Analytics summary and recent request logs can be exported in CSV or JSON.

### Endpoints (Requires `admin:read` scope)
- `GET /admin/analytics`: Returns aggregated analytics JSON summary with overview stats, endpoints breakdown, top consumers, and time-series buckets.
- `GET /admin/analytics/dashboard`: Serves the interactive HTML/JS dashboard with real-time charts and live status metrics.
- `GET /admin/analytics/export`: Exports analytics data as downloadable CSV (`?format=csv`) or JSON (`?format=json`).

## Geo-Distributed Read Replicas (#1051)

The API server is backed by a primary database plus read replicas deployed in
three regions: **US**, **EU**, and **Asia**. This section documents what API
consumers should expect.

### Replication topology

```
                    ┌─────────────────────┐
   writes ─────────▶│  Primary (US-East)  │
                    └──────────┬──────────┘
                               │ async replication
              ┌────────────────┼────────────────┐
              ▼                ▼                ▼
      ┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐ ┌──────────────┐
      │ Replica (US) │ │ Replica (EU) │ │ Replica (Asia)│
      └──────────────┘ └──────────────┘ └──────────────┘
              ▲                ▲                ▲
              └──── reads routed to nearest ───┘
```

- All writes go to the primary.
- Reads are routed to the replica nearest the caller (by region/edge).
- Replication is **asynchronous**, so replicas may lag behind the primary.

### Read/write splitting

The server splits traffic automatically based on the HTTP method and route:

| Operation | Target | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` / `HEAD` / `OPTIONS` | Nearest read replica | Read-only, safe to serve from a replica |
| `POST` / `PUT` / `PATCH` / `DELETE` | Primary | Always consistent with the latest write |
| Read-after-write (`?consistent=true`) | Primary | Opt-in strong consistency for a single request |

Clients that need to observe their own writes immediately can pass
`?consistent=true` (or the `X-Consistency: strong` header) to force the
request to the primary. This is slower but guarantees the response reflects
all writes acknowledged before the request started.

### Replica routing

- The server selects the replica with the lowest measured latency from the
  caller's region, falling back to the primary if no replica is healthy.
- The chosen target is reported in the `X-Served-By` response header
  (`primary`, `replica-us`, `replica-eu`, `replica-asia`).
- Routing is transparent: response bodies and status codes are identical
  regardless of which replica served the request.

### Eventual consistency guarantees

- Reads served from a replica may be **stale by up to the replica lag**
  (typically well under a second, but not bounded by a hard SLA).
- Monotonic reads are **not** guaranteed across requests unless
  `?consistent=true` is used.
- Writes are only acknowledged once the primary has committed them; a
  subsequent read from the primary always reflects the write.

### Replica lag monitoring

- Replica lag is tracked per region and exposed via
  `GET /admin/replicas` (requires `admin:read` scope):

```json
{
  "primary": { "region": "us-east", "healthy": true },
  "replicas": [
    { "id": "replica-us", "region": "us", "healthy": true, "lagMs": 42 },
    { "id": "replica-eu", "region": "eu", "healthy": true, "lagMs": 118 },
    { "id": "replica-asia", "region": "asia", "healthy": false, "lagMs": null }
  ]
}
```

- The current lag of the serving replica is included on every response as
  `X-Replica-Lag-Ms` (omitted when served by the primary).

### Failover

- If a replica is unhealthy or its lag exceeds the configured threshold, it
  is removed from the routing pool and traffic fails over to the primary.
- Failover is automatic and requires no client changes; clients may observe
  a temporary increase in latency and a `X-Served-By: primary` header.
- When all replicas in a region are unavailable, requests from that region
  are served by the primary until a replica recovers.
